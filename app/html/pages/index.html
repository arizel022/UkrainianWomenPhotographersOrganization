            Education
          </h3>
          <p class="project-card__text">
            For the Ukrainian women photography organization, education is a key aspect of the work in addition
            to exhibitions and publications. Our educational activities take place on residencies at conferences and
            as guests of other institutions and also online.
            The rapid changes in photography call for active engagement. We are faced with new kinds of images
            every day. Photographers no longer necessarily press the shutter release, but copy, edit, remix and
            recontextualise existing material. They write codes and let algorithms generate images. We are very
            open in our engagement with these changes, researching contemporary developments and participating
            in the discourse on photography. We are committed to a reflective examination of photographic
            medium and wish to encourage an independent, thoughtful and creative use of photography.
            We welcome those who are just starting their creative journey, and those who are already
            professionally engaged in photography.
